		<p>ECO-Keeper is a casual game that focuses on bringing trash to recycling machines in return for recycled material. Using this material allows the player to unlock more areas in the map and obtain upgrades to make trash collection easier. In the final state of the game, it features 4 areas (including the starting area) and 4 upgrades with 2 of them having levels.</p>
		<p>For the last 2 months of my time at Full Sail University, these months typically known as Open Portfolio, we were tasked to start or continue a project to help contribute to our portfolios. Rather than continuing with the team that was creating Relic of the Hollow King, I thought it would be best for me to pursue my own project. The final project I chose became ECO-Keeper.</p>
		<p>I was the sole programmer and artist for the game, with the usage of some free-to-use assets found on itch.io (see game's credits for additional information). This project served as a way for me to actually get my hands into using Godot Engine, and it allowed me to learn how to utilize the engine. This project shows what I was able to accomplish within 2 months using an engine I was not entirely familiar with.</p>
