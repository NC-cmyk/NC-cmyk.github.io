		<p style="font-style: italic">" Welcome to Asteroid Mining Co. Where we believe the best mining strategy is violence. You've been promoted to an asteroid fighter class mining ship. Earth has no shortage of weapons, but we are a little short on gold, so your job is to gather this by any means necessary. "</p>
		<hr/>
		<p>Asteroid Mining Co. is a 2D/3D Asteroids-like game made using C++ with the <a href="https://github.com/skypjack/entt" target="_blank">EnTT</a> and <a href="https://gateware-development.gitlab.io/gcompiler/index.html" target="_blank">Gateware</a> libraries. This was a portfolio project made with a team of 6 people, including myself. The game features 3 difficulties, 2 different weapons, at least 3 asteroid variations, and an enemy that attempts to hinder the player's progress.</p>
		<p>The idea for this project was to make a 2D game, based on a certain category of classic games, using 3D assets. As mentioned earlier, my team decided to go with a game based on Asteroids.</p>
		<p>I mainly handled the UI within this project. I coded the health bar and score updates. I also made the models for the heart and any UI text present in the game (score, menus, etc.). However, the text was made using free assets provided to us by the course instructors.</p>
		<p>This unfortunately does not have an online demo or a public repo, but this may be updated for when it does.</p>
