		<p style="font-style:italic">" In Relic of the Hollow King, the kingdom of Eldros is crumbling under an ancient curse. You play as Kael, a warrior caught in a battle between guardians of balance and a cult seeking to awaken a sealed horror. Armed with a rune-etched blade and mystical relics, you’ll explore dungeons, ruins, and war-torn lands, solving puzzles and battling fierce enemies. Combat is fast-paced, requiring skillful swordplay, magic, and quick reflexes. Each dungeon holds powerful bosses tied to the Hollow King’s fate. The choices you make will determine whether Eldros is saved or lost forever. "</p>

		<p>Relic of the Hollow King is a top-down RPG with exploring dungeons, collecting relics, and powering up your character as the main focus. For the time I was involved with the game, the game featured 2 relics, 4 different magic spells, and 1 dungeon.</p>
		<p>Our project was to be an Unreal Engine project after learning how to develop in UE the month before. We were free to make any kind of game, as long as it was made in UE, so the team had settled on a top-down RPG, mainly inspired by Zelda games.</p>
		<p>I was the primary UI programmer for the game's first month of development, but I have also contributed 2D artwork for it. Within the game, I made the prototype player HUD and implemented the settings menu. My last contribution to the game was getting the dialogue system to be functional.</p>
