		<h1>Nikole Chua : Video Game Developer</h1>
		<p>I am a video game developer and currently an undergraduate at Full Sail University for Game Development. I have experience working in a couple different game engines and programming languages.</p>

		<h3>Projects I have worked on</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://simmer.io/@AngryToucansTm/shipwreck" target="_blank">Scrapwreck</a> - A 3D first-person shooter game made in Unity and C#. This was a midterm project made with a team of 3 people, including myself. I had mainly handled the enemy programming in this project.</li>
			<li>Asteroid Mining Co. - A 2D/3D Asteroids-like game made using C++ with the <a href="https://github.com/skypjack/entt" target="_blank">EnTT</a> and <a href="https://gateware-development.gitlab.io/gcompiler/index.html" target="_blank">Gateware</a> libraries. This was a portfolio project made with a team of 6 people, including myself. I mainly handled the UI within this project. (This unfortunately does not have an online demo or a public repo, but this may be updated for when it does.)</li>
			<li><a href="https://indifferent-kitchen-std.itch.io/relic-of-the-hollow-king" target="_blank">Relic of the Hollow King</a> - A top-down RPG with exploring dungeons, collecting relics, and powering up your character as the main focus. It is a currently ongoing project. I am the primary UI programmer for the game, but I have also contributed 2D artwork for it.</li>
